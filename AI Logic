-2 different loops will evaluate moves and the game

	-Overall Function
		-Some function to evaluate the score of the board will be determined by the neural net that evaluates based on following inputs
		-total # of inputs into the scoring function: 127
			-126 inputs from territories 
			-1 input accounting for troops
	-Territories-total of 126 inputs, 3 per territory		
		-Adjacencies
			-# of adjacent territory nodes (1-6)
			-ReLu (1-6)=input
		-Owner of the continent set
			-does the player own it?
			-(0-1), #of territories in that set owned by player/# of total territories in that set
		-Set bonus
			-Is the set producing a bonus (0,1), 0 for no, 1 for yes
	-Troops
		-evaluate after each turn cycle (after all other players have gone), at the end of the turn (after the fortify phase)
		- ReLu[t(friendly)-t(enemy)]=input
		-the change in friendly troops on the board minus the change in enemy troops on the board
